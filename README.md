# 🌍 Global Upstream Oil & Gas Dashboard

This Power BI dashboard provides a strategic overview of the global upstream oil and gas sector, focusing on production, proven reserves, supply trends, and associated CO₂ emissions. It is designed for industry analysts, researchers, and decision-makers to explore exploration and production (E&P) dynamics across key oil-producing countries.

---

## 📌 Objective

To analyze and visualize upstream oil & gas activity worldwide, offering insights into:
- Global production volumes and trends
- Proven reserves distribution
- Country-level supply growth
- Environmental impact via CO₂ emissions

---

## 📊 Key Features

- **Total Global Oil Production**: 97.5 million BOE/day  
- **Year-over-Year Growth**: +1.2%  
- **Top 10 Producing Countries**: Saudi Arabia, Russia, USA, Canada, Iraq, China, Iran, etc.  
- **Proven Reserves Map**: Highlights reserve-rich nations (Saudi Arabia, Canada, Russia, Iran)  
- **CO₂ Emissions vs Production**: Tracks emissions growth relative to oil & gas output  

---

## 🔍 Strategic Insights

- **Saudi Arabia, Russia, and the US** continue to lead global oil production and reserve holdings.
- Despite modest YoY production growth (+1.2%), emissions continue to rise at a faster pace.
- Reserve-rich nations may hold pricing and supply power in OPEC+ negotiations and global market shifts.
- Geopolitical developments, carbon regulations, and investment shifts toward renewables are critical external variables impacting upstream dynamics.
